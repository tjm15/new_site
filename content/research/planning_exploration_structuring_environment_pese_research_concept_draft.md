*Operationalised in practice as the **Planning Exploration Studio***

## **1. Positioning and Scope**

The Planning Exploration & Structuring Environment (PESE) is advanced as a **third institutional digital pillar** within contemporary planning systems, operating alongside—but analytically, epistemically, and functionally distinct from—established modes of **plan‑making** and **development management (DM)** workflow assistance. It is proposed not as an incremental enhancement to existing tools, but as a qualitatively different form of digital infrastructure addressing a domain of planning practice that has thus far remained weakly formalised and poorly supported.

Where plan‑making systems are primarily oriented toward the collation of evidence, the evaluation of scenarios, and the production of statutory artefacts, and DM systems toward application assessment, constraint verification, and officer report generation, PESE addresses a different and hitherto under‑institutionalised domain of planning work. Specifically, it intervenes in the **pre‑decisional, exploratory, and sense‑making phase** in which ill‑defined planning problems are progressively rendered intelligible, negotiable, and tractable, prior to their formal inscription into policy documents, recommendations, conditions, or refusals.

This phase is neither incidental nor peripheral. It is the phase in which the practical boundaries of possibility are first encountered, where design, policy, infrastructure, and economics are brought into relation, and where many of the most consequential judgements are implicitly formed. Yet it is also the phase least well supported by existing digital systems, and most dependent on informal discussion, tacit expertise, and iterative documentation.

PESE is neither a workflow engine, nor a decision system, nor an optimisation apparatus. Rather, it is instantiated in practice as a **Planning Exploration Studio**: a shared, live institutional workspace designed to support collective inquiry into complex planning situations. Its primary function is to infer, externalise, and sustain an explorable structure from unstructured planning material, thereby enabling higher‑quality reasoning, earlier convergence, and more design‑responsive outcomes, without displacing human judgement or institutional authority.

## **2. The Institutional Gap**

Despite sustained investment in digital planning systems, a significant institutional gap remains between formal procedural workflows and the lived cognitive practice of planning. Current tools provide limited support for the forms of reasoning that dominate the early and intermediate stages of planning work, including:

- exploratory option formation and comparative design reasoning;
- articulation of trade‑offs without premature quantification or forced commensuration;
- critical interrogation of viability claims prior to adversarial consolidation;
- constructive, cross‑disciplinary negotiation under conditions of uncertainty;
- development of shared understanding in advance of formal decision thresholds.

In practice, these activities are mediated through fragmented meetings, lengthy and iterative reports, informal email correspondence, and the largely tacit cognitive labour of individual planners and consultants. The absence of a shared, inspectable, and revisable structure through which such reasoning can be conducted collectively contributes to recurrent misunderstanding, late‑stage conflict, and an over‑reliance on defensive documentation as a substitute for early analytical clarity.

The cumulative effect is a planning process that often converges slowly, expends disproportionate effort resolving avoidable misunderstandings, and defers critical design and viability issues until positions have hardened. PESE responds to this condition by treating **structuring itself as a first‑order institutional activity**, rather than as a preparatory or ancillary task subsumed within documentation or deferred to individual expertise.

## **3. Core Function: Structuring Pre-Application Negotiation**

At the core of PESE lies the capacity to **structure pre‑application negotiation itself**, rather than merely to process planning artefacts. While documents, drawings, and datasets remain important inputs, PESE is fundamentally oriented toward the *interactive, dialogic, and iterative* nature of pre‑application engagement, where positions, expectations, and proposals are formed through negotiation rather than through fixed submissions.

PESE therefore ingests and interprets heterogeneous and unstructured material as it arises *within* pre‑application negotiation, including but not limited to:

- planning statements, design and access statements, and supporting narratives;
- viability appraisals, financial models, development appraisals, and cost assumptions;
- development plan policies, supplementary planning documents, and associated guidance;
- spatial datasets, drawings, diagrams, and other visual material;
- consultation responses, objections, representations, and stakeholder submissions;
- informal records of meetings, correspondence, and negotiated positions.

Rather than treating such artefacts as repositories of settled facts, PESE approaches them as **provisional, strategic, and negotiable claims** articulated within the dynamics of pre‑application negotiation. These materials are understood not as endpoints, but as conversational moves through which actors signal constraints, aspirations, risks, and red lines. Through computational inference combined with planner‑guided interpretation, these negotiated inputs are translated into a provisional structural representation that captures the evolving state of the pre‑application discussion, comprising:

- binding and non‑binding constraints, including statutory, policy, and physical limits;
- asserted limits, red lines, benchmarks, and thresholds advanced by different actors;
- negotiable parameters and design levers across form, mix, layout, and phasing;
- conditional acceptability relations (e.g. “acceptable if…”, “reasonable provided that…”);
- sensitive assumptions, uncertainties, and points of contestation;
- interactions and feedbacks between policy intent, spatial form, infrastructure, and economic viability.

This inferred structure is explicitly provisional, situational, and contestable, reflecting the inherently fluid and relational character of pre‑application negotiation. Its epistemic value does not derive from authority or finality, but from its capacity to **render the problem space visible, interrogable, and collectively navigable**, allowing actors to engage with the same underlying structure even where substantive disagreement persists.

## **4. The Design–Reasoning Space**

Internally, PESE maintains what is here termed a **design–reasoning space**: a dynamic, evolving representation of feasible configurations and their associated reasoning consequences. This space functions as a shared cognitive substrate in which design, policy, and economic considerations are brought into explicit relation.

In contrast to parametric design systems or optimisation‑led planning models, this space is not pre‑specified through a fixed set of variables, objectives, or performance functions. Instead, it is **continuously inferred, reshaped, and refined** as new material is introduced, challenged, or revised through interaction. The boundaries of the space are therefore emergent rather than imposed.

The design–reasoning space encodes, inter alia:

- regions of feasibility and infeasibility, including zones of marginal or conditional viability;
- distinctions between binding, contingent, and discretionary constraints;
- conditional gates governing acceptability and reasonableness;
- trade‑off relations that resist reduction to scalar metrics or single objectives;
- sensitivity zones in which marginal changes generate disproportionate effects.

This space constitutes the shared substrate upon which all subsequent exploration, negotiation, and refinement within PESE is conducted, enabling structured inquiry without collapsing plural considerations into a single evaluative logic.

## **5. Interaction Surfaces**

The design–reasoning space is made accessible through four integrated yet analytically distinct interaction surfaces. These should be understood not as separate tools or modules, but as alternative analytical lenses applied to the same underlying structure, each foregrounding a different mode of reasoning.

### **5.1 Planning Surface**

The planning surface supports early strategic reasoning by enabling:

- examination of whether policy‑compliant or policy‑legible solutions are attainable;
- exploration of density, mix, and built form within strategic and spatial constraints;
- identification of internal policy tensions, trade‑offs, and unrealistic expectations;
- structured feedback of insights into formal plan‑making processes and evidence bases.

### **5.2 Design Exploration Surface**

The design exploration surface facilitates:

- generation of meaningfully differentiated design configurations rather than minor variants;
- identification of design moves that activate, relax, or reframe critical constraints;
- systematic exploration of mitigation strategies, spatial responses, and design alternatives;
- iterative collaboration between planners, designers, engineers, and technical specialists.

### **5.3 Negotiation Surface**

The negotiation surface is oriented toward constructive convergence, enabling:

- articulation of conditional acceptability in place of binary agreement or refusal;
- explicit and inspectable representation of trade‑offs and concessions;
- real‑time testing of adjustments and alternative configurations;
- reduction in reliance on repeated reports and procedurally redundant meetings.

### **5.4 Viability Surface**

The viability surface treats economic material as structured and contestable claims rather than as exogenous vetoes. It supports:

- extraction and comparison of key assumptions, benchmarks, and thresholds;
- identification of sensitive variables, leverage points, and design–economic interactions;
- visualisation of feedbacks between design decisions, policy requirements, and economic performance;
- transparent engagement with capital constraints while resisting opacity and strategic obfuscation.

## **6. Role of AI within PESE**

Within PESE, artificial intelligence operates in two complementary roles:

1. **Planner‑assistant**, responsible for organising unstructured inputs, maintaining shared state, tracking the evolution of assumptions and options, and reducing administrative and cognitive burden.
2. **Process‑level advocate**, oriented toward the quality of planning reasoning itself—advocating for clarity, early problem‑solving, explicit articulation of trade‑offs, and defensible convergence, without advocating for any particular actor or outcome.

In this configuration, the AI system proposes provisional structure, supports challenge and revision, updates the design–reasoning space, and preserves institutional memory. Normative judgement, discretion, and authority remain firmly human, with the system functioning as an augmentative rather than substitutive actor.

## **7. Relationship to Pre-Application, Plan-Making, and Development Management Workflows**

PESE is explicitly designed to complement rather than supplant existing planning workflows, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the **pre‑application stage** as a site of constructive negotiation rather than informal risk management. In particular, it:

- supplies structured insight and refined options to plan‑making systems;
- informs development management assessment, reporting, and recommendation‑making;
- mitigates late‑stage surprise, escalation, and adversarial breakdown.

By relocating critical reasoning activity earlier in the planning process, PESE aims to enhance both procedural efficiency and substantive outcome quality, while preserving the formal integrity of statutory decision‑making.

## **8. Research Contributions and Implications**

The concept of PESE advances several contributions to planning research and practice:

- articulation of a previously under‑theorised digital layer within planning system architecture;
- formalisation of structuring as a mode of institutional cognition rather than clerical preparation;
- a viable alternative to optimisation‑centric or document‑centric planning AI paradigms;
- a transparent and design‑sensitive framework for engaging with viability;
- a foundation for empirical investigation into convergence dynamics, design quality, and institutional performance.

More broadly, PESE provides a lens through which to reconsider how planning institutions reason collectively under conditions of complexity, uncertainty, and constraint.

## **9. Conclusion**

The Planning Exploration & Structuring Environment constitutes an attempt to provide planning institutions with a shared space for collective reasoning prior to the crystallisation of positions and the proliferation of formal documentation. By rendering structure explicit, provisional, and open to contestation, PESE supports more robust judgement without automating decisions, and more timely convergence without suppressing disagreement.

In practical deployments, PESE is encountered as a **Planning Exploration Studio**: an institutional thinking space that complements plan‑making and development management by enabling earlier, collective, and design‑sensitive reasoning across policy, spatial, infrastructural, and economic domains.
